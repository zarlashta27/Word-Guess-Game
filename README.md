# Word-Guess-Game

Hangman game in JavaScript

This is the classic Hangman game where the player is given a word and has 12 chances to guess the word one letter at a time.

Game Interface:

Blank spaces are displayed on the screen equal to the length of the word chosen randomly from a list. Player can guess a letter by pressing a keyboard key. If the letter is present in the word, the blank spaces are replaced with the letter at the right position. If the letter occurs more than once in the word, each occurence of the letter is replaced for a correct guess.

A letter can be guessed only once and for each wrong guess, the chances are decreased by 1. A new word is chosen after a successful game or after 12 guesses are up. 

 The goal of this project is to learn more about object-oriented programming and become more comfortable using jQuery to build the front end.

To try it out, open index.html in your browser of choice.

Thanks and enjoy!
